# Music-Generation
Implementation of Music Generation in PyTorch where a Recurrent Neural Network based language model is trained on midi dataset to generate
completely new music.

Refer [this](http://warmspringwinds.github.io/pytorch/rnns/2018/01/27/learning-to-generate-lyrics-and-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/) blog post for better understanding

# Dataset 
The midi dataset can be downloaded here : [The MIDI Dataset](http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~boulanni/icml2012)

```Note : Here Nottingham dataset is used,but,you can use any dataset of your choice to generate music of your choice```

# Requirements
1. PyTorch
2. Python
3. Numpy
4. Skimage
5. IPython
